•	Designed and implemented an automated health hazard analysis tool for divers, utilizing Indian Ocean Region acoustic ecology. The tool generates health hazard reports and noise maps to monitor underwater acoustic levels, aiding in safe dive site selection and acoustic protective equipment decisions.

•	Led diverse research, including surveys, data analysis, and a thorough hyperbaric medicine literature review in collaboration with medical experts.

• Policy proposal to update diving regulations to include underwater noise exposure.
